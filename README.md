# Virtual-Classroom
http://virtualclassroom48.esy.es/forum/home1.php#
Part of a team of five people which developed Virtual Classroom, a browser based application built on PhP framework Yii, which would enhance the teacher-pupil interaction and had functionalities such as live lecture streaming, discussion forum, record of lectures etc. We followed a proper software development cycle for this including proper documentation and a rapid development model because of limited period of time available for software launch.
